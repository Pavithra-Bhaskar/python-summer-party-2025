This repository documents my progress through the <strong>15-day Python Summer Party Challenge</strong>, hosted by <a href="https://www.interviewmaster.ai/">Interview Master</a>.

Each day, a new challenge is unlocked – inspired by real-world brands – with tasks covering Python fundamentals, data wrangling, logic building, and clean code practices. The best part? It’s fun, community-powered, and completely free.
